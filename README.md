# Paxos Made Easy: The Geometric Meaning and Geometric Proof of Paxos Algorithm

# Paxos算法的几何意义与证明

After several revisions, the correctness of the final version has been proved strictly and gracefully in math, and it is also very easy to understand. 
But for some reason I want to let it hide for a few days, and then it will be officially announced. Please pay attention to this repo :D

该方法经过几次修正后，最终版本的正确性已经得到了严格且优美的数学证明，而且非常容易理解。
不过因为某些原因我想让它先隐藏几天的时间，之后它会正式公布。敬请期待 :D

After you read the final version, you will find that Paxos is indeed the simplest distributed consistency algorithm in the world, which is much simpler and more beautiful than Raft.

当你阅读完最终版本的文章之后，你会发现，Paxos真的是世界上最简单的分布式一致性算法，比Raft简单且优美的太多了。
